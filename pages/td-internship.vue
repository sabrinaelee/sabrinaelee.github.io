            <h5>1. Inclusive Design</h5>
            <div class="td-body-text-indent">
              <h4>
                Always consider the needs of the users which you are designing
                for, especially the needs that are often excluded or overlooked.
                This requires designers to gain a full understanding of the
                diversity of users and ensure that they address the wide range
                of user needs, motivations, and aspirations within the final
                solution.
              </h4>
            </div>
            <h5>2. Perspective</h5>
            <div class="td-body-text-indent">
              <h4>
                Don‚Äôt assume that the users that you are designing for share the
                same needs or opinions as you. It‚Äôs important to understand that
                you are designing for a diverse range of individuals with unique
                behaviours and reactions. Therefore, it‚Äôs essential to conduct
                usability testing to understand how your designs are percieved
                by real users.
              </h4>

            <div class="td-body-text-indent">
              <h4>
                Strive to create designs that do not confuse users and ‚Äúdon‚Äôt
                make them think‚Äù. Good design involves ensuring that the flow of
                a design is clear to the user and is easy to understand and use.
                Your designs are meant to make the lives of users easier not
                more difficult.

          While working at the lab, we had a few opportunities to team up with
          other interns to explore common problem space and how we might solve
          them. For this project, I teamed up with Brayden, a software developer
          intern at the lab, to address the struggles of mental health that many
          students experience on a daily basis.

          developing an understanding of their needs, their motivations and
          behaviours. This information was essential to the design process as it
          helped me to create the optimal solution for the intended user.
